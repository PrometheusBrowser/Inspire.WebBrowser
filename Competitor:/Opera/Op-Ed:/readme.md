>#The Hindenburg Report
>Hindenburg Research released a detailed report about Opera in 2020 outlining alleged fraud and illegal activities. Hindenburg is an investment firm that researches publicly-traded companies and shorts their stocks if they find sufficient evidence of investor fraud before releasing its report. Since Hindenburg directly profits from the company's decline in stock, it's not an impartial source of information, but the company's other reports into companies like Nikola have held up to scrutiny.

## Predatory Behavior:
quote:
>Hindenburg alleged that when the Opera browser continued losing users (due to competition from Google and Apple), the company shifted gears to building mobile apps that provided predatory short-term loans. The interest rates on those loans ranged from 365-876% per year, and loan terms from 7-29 days. Opera also falsely advertised longer loan terms and lower interest rates in the app descriptions, because the Google Play Store had rules against predatory loan services.
>
>The loan apps specifically targeted customers in Kenya, India, and Nigeria. Hindenburg also confirmed through user reports and a former employee that two of the apps, OKash and OPesa, asked for permission to the phone contacts during the setup process. The service would then start sending threatening messages to the user's contacts when a borrower was late on their payments. The issue was also covered by local media prior to Hindenburg's report.
>
>The money from these loan apps amounted to 42.5% of Opera's revenue by mid-2019. Yes, **almost half of Opera's revenue came from extracting money from people in developing countries** with false advertising and direct harassment.
...
>The financial apps having an average high review score doesn't prove that the report was wrong. It just means a lot of people didn't have issues, or Opera paid for positive reviews, or a mix of both. The last sentence is also hiding the fact that Opera [quietly updated the loan terms](https://techtrendske.co.ke/2020/01/20/opera-predatory-loan-apps-with-awful-interest-rates-still-existent-on-the-google-play-store/#:~:text=Update%20Jan%2020th%2C%203%3A20%20PM%3A%20Included%20OKash%20Compliance) after the report was made public, so the apps would pass Google's policies and not be pulled from the Play Store.

## Chasing the trends
>Opera switched to a Chromium software base in 2013, so the interface and features on top are the only significant differences between it and Chrome, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers. Opera doesn't have the financial backing of a big tech company, so some features that mainly exist to generate revenue aren't necessarily unreasonable. There's a news feed called Opera News that has ads, for example, and Opera Mini has an integrated crypto wallet.

## Cryptocurrency
>Opera's next big experiment was "Web3" and cryptocurrency because that was trendy at the time. The company [added a cryptocurrency wallet](https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2018/09/opera-delivers-the-first-desktop-browser-with-built-in-crypto-wallet-access-labs-version/) to its desktop and Android web browsers in 2018, along with support for Ethereum Dapps. Those features are not useful for most people, but it was a great way to generate hype from cryptocurrency fans and investors, so it went in the browser. Hindenburg's report also pointed out that Opera invested $30 million in the crypto startup ICST that same year, and the startup's CEO was arrested four days later for financial crimes.
>
>The focus on cryptocurrency and blockchain features continued ramping up at Opera. A separate Opera Crypto Browser was released for desktop platforms and Android in 2022, with such innovative features as a calendar for upcoming NFT releases.
>
>When the market for NFTs and most blockchain projects collapsed in 2022, so did Opera's interest. The company's blog hasn't announced any new crypto features since May 2023, and the download page for Opera Crypto Browser was quietly pulled from Opera's site sometime between August and December 2023. Opera seemingly hasn't migrated the Crypto users to the regular Opera browser yet or told them what's going on, but it's still sending security updates to the Crypto Browser, so at least it's not a security risk like Neon.

## Opera GX
>The most interesting feature of Opera GX, and probably why it became popular in the first place, is the ability to set limits on the browser's CPU, RAM, and network usage. This is mainly helpful when you have the browser open in the background while playing a game, and you want to conserve system resources for the game. It's a cool idea, but the competition has caught up since the browser's introduction: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other web browsers now [automatically put tabs to sleep](https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-chrome-features-to-save-battery-and-make-browsing-smoother/) when they're not needed.
...
>There are almost no features available in Opera's web browsers that aren't also in competing web browsers. Firefox, Safari, and Vivaldi are all better alternatives, and Vivaldi is built by some former Opera employees, including former Opera Software CEO Jon von Tetzchner. Don't use Brave Browser, either.
