>#The Hindenburg Report
>Hindenburg Research released a detailed report about Opera in 2020 outlining alleged fraud and illegal activities. Hindenburg is an investment firm that researches publicly-traded companies and shorts their stocks if they find sufficient evidence of investor fraud before releasing its report. Since Hindenburg directly profits from the company's decline in stock, it's not an impartial source of information, but the company's other reports into companies like Nikola have held up to scrutiny.

## Predatory Behavior:
quote:
>Hindenburg alleged that when the Opera browser continued losing users (due to competition from Google and Apple), the company shifted gears to building mobile apps that provided predatory short-term loans. The interest rates on those loans ranged from 365-876% per year, and loan terms from 7-29 days. Opera also falsely advertised longer loan terms and lower interest rates in the app descriptions, because the Google Play Store had rules against predatory loan services.
>
>The loan apps specifically targeted customers in Kenya, India, and Nigeria. Hindenburg also confirmed through user reports and a former employee that two of the apps, OKash and OPesa, asked for permission to the phone contacts during the setup process. The service would then start sending threatening messages to the user's contacts when a borrower was late on their payments. The issue was also covered by local media prior to Hindenburg's report.
>
>The money from these loan apps amounted to 42.5% of Opera's revenue by mid-2019. Yes, **almost half of Opera's revenue came from extracting money from people in developing countries** with false advertising and direct harassment.
...
>The financial apps having an average high review score doesn't prove that the report was wrong. It just means a lot of people didn't have issues, or Opera paid for positive reviews, or a mix of both. The last sentence is also hiding the fact that Opera [quietly updated the loan terms](https://techtrendske.co.ke/2020/01/20/opera-predatory-loan-apps-with-awful-interest-rates-still-existent-on-the-google-play-store/#:~:text=Update%20Jan%2020th%2C%203%3A20%20PM%3A%20Included%20OKash%20Compliance) after the report was made public, so the apps would pass Google's policies and not be pulled from the Play Store.
...
>The most interesting feature of Opera GX, and probably why it became popular in the first place, is the ability to set limits on the browser's CPU, RAM, and network usage. This is mainly helpful when you have the browser open in the background while playing a game, and you want to conserve system resources for the game. It's a cool idea, but the competition has caught up since the browser's introduction: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other web browsers now [automatically put tabs to sleep](https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-chrome-features-to-save-battery-and-make-browsing-smoother/) when they're not needed.
...
>There are almost no features available in Opera's web browsers that aren't also in competing web browsers. Firefox, Safari, and Vivaldi are all better alternatives, and Vivaldi is built by some former Opera employees, including former Opera Software CEO Jon von Tetzchner. Don't use Brave Browser, either.
